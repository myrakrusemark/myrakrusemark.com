<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Role:</strong> UX Designer<br>
<strong>Focus:</strong> Customer-facing portal for VIP CAP platform<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Multi-phase project with iterative design cycles</p>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>ANPI's VIP CAP platform needed a comprehensive customer portal that would give enterprise customers easy access to their telecommunications services, account information, and support resources. The existing system required customers to contact support for basic information and service changes, creating inefficiencies for both customers and support staff.</p>

<p>The challenge was to create a self-service portal that would empower customers to manage their own services while reducing the burden on support teams.</p>

<h2>Design Solution</h2>
<div class="content-with-image">
    <div class="text-content">
        <p>I designed a modular widget-based interface that allows customers to customize their dashboard and quickly access the information most relevant to their needs. The flexible architecture accommodates different customer types—from small businesses to large enterprises—with varying information priorities.</p>

<h3>Customizable Widget Dashboard</h3>
<div class="content-with-image">
    <div class="text-content">
        <p>The core of the portal is a customizable dashboard where customers can arrange widgets based on their priorities. Customers can drag and drop widgets to reorganize their view, hide widgets they don't need, and quickly access the tools most important to their daily operations.</p>

        <p>This approach recognizes that different users have different needs—a billing manager cares about invoices and payment history, while a technical administrator needs quick access to service status and configuration tools.</p>

<h3>Administration and Access Management</h3>

<p style="text-align: center; color: #666; font-style: italic; margin-top: -20px;">Wireframes showing the administration and access management workflow</p>

<p>Customers can view real-time service status, configure settings, and manage their telecommunications services without needing to contact support. This self-service capability significantly reduced support requests for routine tasks.</p>

<h3>Widget Customization</h3>

<p>Each widget can be configured to display the specific information customers need. The flexible design allows for resizing, repositioning, and customizing widget content to match individual workflow requirements.</p>

<h2>Design Process</h2>

<h3>Dashboard Prototype Evolution</h3>

<p style="text-align: center; color: #666; font-style: italic; margin-top: -20px;">Dashboard prototype showing the widget-based layout with status map, billing, and service information</p>

<p>I started with low-fidelity wireframes to quickly explore different layout options and information hierarchies. This rapid prototyping approach allowed us to test multiple concepts with stakeholders before investing in high-fidelity designs.</p>

<h3>Iterative Refinement</h3>
<p>Through multiple design iterations, I refined the interface based on:</p>
<ul>
    <li>User research with existing customers to identify pain points and priorities</li>
    <li>Stakeholder feedback on business requirements and technical constraints</li>
    <li>Usability testing to validate the widget-based approach</li>
    <li>Technical feasibility discussions with the development team</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Customizable dashboard with drag-and-drop widgets</li>
    <li>Real-time service status monitoring</li>
    <li>Self-service configuration and management tools</li>
    <li>Account management and billing information</li>
    <li>Integrated support and documentation</li>
    <li>Responsive design for desktop and mobile access</li>
    <li>Role-based access control for enterprise teams</li>
</ul>

<h2>Impact</h2>
